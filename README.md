<h2>You like FlexRadio? Your spent your last money on a Flex6600, 6400, 6500? Right decission! But now you need to save money for your Maestro? Man, this might take a while, i know... So what to do meanwhile? Hey - grab 75€ and you are back in the game until you can buy a maestro :P!<br></h2>
</p>

<p>
  Yes! Here is something for you! How about using an external DJ-Midi-Controller to control your FlexRadio? Thanks to FlexRadio and Stephen Houser this is already possible - but now its even easier!
</p>
<p>No more Node-Red-Setup needed, no Raspberry setup, no update hell, no need to become a linux expert - and no need to use an Ipad, OSX or whatever!</p> 
<p>
  <b>And even better: Your friends all have flex radios and they let you play with them? EASY going! You can jump through all the different flex radios with your fingertips! Take a look at the entering configuration mode instructions down below!</b>
</p>
<p>
Just buy a Hercules DJ-Control Starlight USB, download the software here (using the BatchStarter.exe for Windows 10/11 to start it - hint: install donetframework first => complete package is in the <a href="http://www.hamradioland.de/rh.zip" target=_blank>DOWNLOAD package for WINDOWS 10/11</a> here!), install the controller, edit the public/config.json and choose your FlexRadios-IP and !!!!WOW!!!! ITS WORKING OUT OF THE BOX!!!!
</p>
<p>
  The Software is designed to use allmost of the buttons of the hercules console. Down below you can see how the buttons are mapped (which cld be changed in public/hercules.xlsx). What is described for Slice A will also be on Slice B - Green, Yellow, Purple work for each Slices A and B. <b>Since they are the same for both Slices, i only described them for the left side :)</b><br/> Blue means global and not slice specific functionality.

### FAQ
Q: Which controllers are supported?
A: Only a Hercules DJ Control Starlight USB controller is supported so far. Since its damn cheap and reliable, why wasting my time with others... :P

Q: Can you support controller xyz?
A: Yes, i can, but you need to donate one to me! Since this software is GLP3 - just implement it for yourself, create a pull request with a new controller implementation included. I will add it to the project.

Q: Can you please add function xyz?
A: Yes, i can - if you cant, i wld add this function if the need and the time permits. 

Q: I need help....
A: No problem, contact me, dm5xx, under the domain @gmx.de or take a look here: <a href="http://www.remoteswitch.de" target=_blank>www.remoteswitch.de</a>
