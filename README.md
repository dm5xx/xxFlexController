<h2>You like FlexRadio? Your spent your last money on a Flex6600, 6400, 6500? Right decission! But now you need to save money for your Maestro? Man, this might take a while, i know... So what to do meanwhile? Hey - grab 75€ and you are back in the game!<br></h2>
</p>

<p>
Yes! Here is something for you! How about using an external DJ-Midi-Controller to control your FlexRadio? Thanks to FlexRadio and Stephen Houser this is already possible - but now its even easier!
<p>No more Node-Red-Setup needed, no Raspberry setup, no update hell, no need to become a linux expert - and no need to use an Ipad, OSX or whatever!
</p>
<p>
Just buy a Hercules DJ-Control Starlight USB, download the software here (using the BatchStarter.exe for Windows 10/11 to start it), install the controller, edit the public/config.json and choose your FlexRadios-IP and !!!!WOW!!!! ITS WORKING OUT OF THE BOX!!!!
</p>
<p>
  The Software is designed to use all most of the buttons of the hercules console. Down below you can see how the buttons are mapped. What is described for Slice A will also be on Slice B - Green, Yellow, Purple work for each Slice - A and B. Blue are global functionality. Since they are the same for both Slices, i only described than for the left side :)
