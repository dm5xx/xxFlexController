Yes! Here is something for you! How about using an external DJ-Midi-Controller to control your FlexRadio? Thanks to FlexRadio and Stephen Houser this is already possible - but now its even easier!
<p>No more Node-Red-Setup needed, no Raspberry setup, no update hell, no need to become a linux expert - and no need to use an Ipad, OSX or whatever!

<p>
Just buy a Hercules DJ-Control Starlight USB, download the software here (using the BatchStarter.exe for Windows 10/11 to start it), install the controller, edit the public/config.json and choose your FlexRadios-IP and !!!!WOW!!!! ITS WORKING OUT OF THE BOX!!!!
